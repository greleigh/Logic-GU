The talk will be devoted to the formal connections between two canonical types of axiomatizations for the truth predicate: the disquotational scheme and the compositional clauses.
We will be interested in measuring the "logical distance" between the two canonical sets of principles and determining whether each of them "determine" the other.
Working in the framework of axiomatic truth theories we shall consider various ways of formalizing the above two questions and present the current state of art.
The talk initializes the project (under the same name) which started in Warsaw at the beginning of September.
At the current time there are still much more questions than answers, but we believe that it is worth uncovering this research perspective.
Some questions will be investigated jointly with the Gothenburg logic group.
