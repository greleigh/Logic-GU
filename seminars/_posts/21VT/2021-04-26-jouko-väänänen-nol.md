In the traditional so-called Tarski’s Truth Definition the semantics of first order logic is defined with respect to an assignment of values to the free variables.
A richer family of semantic concepts can be modelled if semantics is defined with respect to a set (a “team”) of such assignments.
This is called team semantics.
<!--more-->
Examples of semantic concepts available in team semantics but not in traditional Tarskian semantics are the concepts of dependence and independence.
Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic based on team semantics.
It has emerged that teams appear naturally in several areas of sciences and humanities, which has made it possible to apply dependence logic and its variants to these areas.
In my talk I will give a quick introduction to the basic ideas of team semantics and dependence logic as well as an overview of some new developments, such as quantitative analysis of team properties, a framework for a multiverse approach to set theory, and probabilistic independence logic inspired by the foundations of quantum mechanics.
