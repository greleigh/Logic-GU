Motivated by the difficulty in proving faithfulness of various modal embeddings (starting with GÃ¶del's translation of intuitionistic logic into S4), we use labelled calculi to obtain simple and uniform faithfulness proofs for the embedding of intermediate logics into their modal companions, and of intuitionistic logic into provability logic, including extensions to infinitary logics.
