Syntax and semantics, often considered as conflicting aspects of logic, have turned out to be intertwined in a methodology for generating complete proof systems for wide families of non-classical logics.  In this formal semantics, models can be considered as purely mathematical objects with  no ontological assumptions upon them. More specifically, by the "labelled formalism", which now is a well-developed methodology, the semantics is turned into an essential component  in the syntax of logical calculi. Thus enriched, the calculi not only constitute a tool for the  automatisation of reasoning, but can also be used at the meta-level to establish general structural properties of logical systems and direct proofs of completeness up to decidability in the terminating case. The calculi, on the other hand, can be used to find simplified models through conservativity results. The method will be illustrated with  gradually generalised semantics, including topological ones such as neighbourhood semantics.
