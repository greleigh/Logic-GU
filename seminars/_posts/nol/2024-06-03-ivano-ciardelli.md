Inquisitive modal logic is a generalization of standard modal logic where the language also contains questions, and modal operators that can be applied to them.
In this talk, I will provide an introductory overview of inquisitive modal logic.
I will review some motivations for the approach, present some prominent examples of inquisitive modal logics, mention some results about them, and outline directions for future work.
