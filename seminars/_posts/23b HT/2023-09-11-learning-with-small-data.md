There is now an acute need for intensive research on the possibility of effective learning with small data. The conference LSD running 11–12 September, organised by the [Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability (CLASP)](https://www.gu.se/en/clasp) and at the department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science is devoted to work on this problem, with application to computational linguistics.
