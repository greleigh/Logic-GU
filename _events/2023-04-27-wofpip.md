University of Gothenburg, 27-28 April, 2023.

This workshop brings together researchers working on different aspects of fixed point logics and ill-founded proofs. The event is sponsored by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation via the research project _Taming Jörmungandr: The Logical Foundations of Circularity_.

## Location

The workshop will take place at the [Humanities faculty building](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=57.69438&mlon=11.98496#map=19/57.69438/11.98496) of the
University of Gothenburg. It is located next to the Korsvägen transport hub and
within walking distance from the city centre.

## Abstracts

### Lide Grotenhuis: Ill-founded proofs for intuitionistic linear-time temporal logic

Ill-founded and cyclic proof calculi have shown to be particularly suitable for modal fixed point logics. The present work is motivated by the question whether such calculi can also be designed for intuitionistic versions of such logics. The main obstacle in applying the standard techniques is the two-dimensional nature of the intuitionistic semantics: Kripke models for intuitionistic modal logic consist of both an intuitionistic and a modal relation, which are required to satisfy some confluence properties. 

In this work we study intuitionistic versions of linear-time temporal logic by considering the language iLTL, which extends intuitionistic propositional logic with the temporal operators 'next' and 'until'. We interpret this language in models satisfying forward confluence and models satisfying both forward and backward confluence. For each of the resulting logics, we present a cut-free complete, ill-founded sequent calculus. Both calculi employ a simple form of nesting that enables formulas to be operated on at different temporal positions. This is joint work with Bahareh Afshari, Graham Leigh and Lukas Zenger. 

### Sebastian Enqvist: Herbrand meets cyclic proofs

Herbrand's theorem provides a sort of computational content to classical logic.
A standard way to prove it uses cut elimination in sequent calculus. In recent
work by Afshari, Hetzl and Leigh, it was shown how to extract Herbrand
disjunctions directly from sequent calculus proofs without eliminating cuts
first. The idea is to associate a higher-order recursion scheme with a given
proof, from which a set of witnessing terms can be extracted. In this talk I
will present ongoing work, joint with Bahareh Afshari and Graham Leigh, in which
we show how such "Herbrand schemes" can be adapted to provide a method for
witness extraction from cyclic sequent calculus proofs in the setting of the
classical theory of inductively defined predicates. Indeed, this is a quite
natural step to take, as recursion schemes in general are cyclic structures.

### Johannes Kloibhofer: Cut elimination in cyclic proofs for temporal logic

We present cut elimination for an annotated cyclic proof system for modal logic with the eventually operator.
In this proof system the usual method of pushing cuts upwards does not necessarily yield a proof.
We circumvent this problem by separating the critical case in the cut reductions, enabling us to
directly obtain a cut-free cyclic proof without a detour via infinitary proofs.
We expect that this method can be extended to more complicated logics and
thereby serve as a starting point for developing cut elimination methods for cyclic proof systems.

### Gianluca Curzi: On the computational expressivity of (circular) proofs with fixed points

We study the computational expressivity of proof systems with fixed point
operators, within the 'proofs-as-programs' paradigm. We start with a calculus
muLJ (due to Clairambault) that extends intuitionistic logic by least and
greatest positive fixed points. Based in the sequent calculus, muLJ admits an
extension to a 'circular' calculus CmuLJ in a standard way.

Our main result is that, perhaps surprisingly, both muLJ and CmuLJ represent the
same first-order functions: those provably total in Pi12-CA0, a subsystem of
second-order arithmetic beyond the 'big five' of reverse mathematics and one of
the strongest theories for which we have an ordinal analysis (due to Rathjen).
This solves various questions in the literature on the computational strength of
(circular) proof systems with fixed points.

For the lower bound we give a realisability interpretation from an extension of
Peano Arithmetic by fixed points that has been shown to be arithmetically
equivalent to Pi12-CA0 (due to Möllerfeld). For the upper bound we give a novel
totality argument for circular proofs with fixed points. In fact we must
formalise this argument itself within Pi12-CA0 in order to obtain the tight
bounds we are after, requiring a choice of higher computability model distinct
from usual type structures for second-order systems (such as Girard-Reynolds'
F). Along the way we develop some novel reverse mathematics for the
Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem.
