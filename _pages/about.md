The logic group is part of the [Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science](https://www.gu.se/flov) at the University of Gothenburg.

Our group has a broad expertise in mathematical, philosophical and computational logic.
We organise a [bi-weekly research seminar]({% link _pages/seminars.md %}), the annual [Lindström Lectures]({% link _pages/lindstrom-lectures.md %}) and various other [logic-themed events]({% link _pages/activities.md %}).
Group members also teach in the [Master in Logic programme]({% link _pages/MiL.md %}).

We are one of the member groups of the [Scandinavian Logic Society]({{ site.data.links.sls.link }}) which organises a number of events promoting logic in the Nordic regions.
