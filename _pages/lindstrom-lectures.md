The Department of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science at the University of Gothenburg launched a lecture series in 2013 to celebrate the singular achievements of Per Lindström, former professor of logic at the department.

Annually, a distinguished logician is invited to deliver a general lecture to the public, and a specialized presentation at the logic seminar.
