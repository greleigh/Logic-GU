    My expertise is in proof theory and its application to computational logic.
    I am particularly interested in expressibility, complexity, and deductive strength in fixed point logics.
    Other topics that I have worked on and/or are currently pursuing include relative computability, reverse mathematics, ordinal analysis, computational content of proofs, automata theory and games.

    Early research on models of arithmetic including compositional theories of truth and transplendent models.
    Later, focus shifted towards Dependence logic and generalized quantifiers as well as the characterization of logical constants. 
    Also interested in the cognitive aspects of logical reasoning.

      My background is in philosophical logic, with a focus on formal systems for trial-and-error processes.
      Recently, my research interests have shifted somewhat towards argumentation theory and (logical) philosophy of language.
      In particular the application of foundational theories in philosophical semantics and pragmatics to practically useful argumentation analysis.

    My research interests sit at the interface between the fields of mathematical, philosophical and computational logic.
    In particular, formal theories of truth, non-classical and modal logics, computational content of theories, and notions of provability.
