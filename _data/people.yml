    My expertise is in proof theory and its application to computational logic.
    I am particularly interested in expressibility, complexity, and deductive strength in fixed point logics.
    Other topics that I have worked on and/or are currently pursuing include relative computability, reverse mathematics, ordinal analysis, computational content of proofs, automata theory and games.

    My research interests lie close to logic, philosophy, and linguistics. In particular, I have been working on the metamathematics of arithmetic, philosophy of mathematics, formal semantics and probabilistic semantics for natural language.

  description:  >
    I am a mathematical logician, with a strong interest in the metamathematics of foundational axiomatic systems.
    My research work is focused on the model theory of arithmetic, the model theory of set theory, and axiomatic theories of truth.

  description: >
    Early research on models of arithmetic including compositional theories of truth and transplendent models.
    Later, focus shifted towards Dependence logic and generalized quantifiers as well as the characterization of logical constants. 
    Also interested in the cognitive aspects of logical reasoning.

  description: >
      My background is in philosophical logic, with a focus on formal systems for trial-and-error processes.
      Recently, my research interests have shifted somewhat towards argumentation theory and (logical) philosophy of language.
      In particular the application of foundational theories in philosophical semantics and pragmatics to practically useful argumentation analysis.

    My research interests sit at the interface between the fields of mathematical, philosophical and computational logic.
    In particular, formal theories of truth, non-classical and modal logics, computational content of theories, and notions of provability.

    Most of my research is motivated by logic, foundations of mathematics and foundations of geometry.
    Concretely, my work is in categorical logic, syntax-semantics dualities, topos theory, general category theory and formal category theory.

    I am interested in the exploration of foundational systems by means of proof theory and (constructive) reverse mathematics.
    At the moment I work in cyclic proof theory, focusing on the soundness conditions of cyclic derivation systems.

    I am a philosopher of mathematics interested in arithmetical concepts.
    I study the concept of natural number, but also adjacent concepts such as “arithmetic function”, “recursive function”, “computation”, “computability”, “encoding”, “equality”, “identity”, or “infinity”.
