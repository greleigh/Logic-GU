  <h1 class="page-title">The Tenth Scandinavian Logic Symposium</h1>
  
<p>The Tenth Scandinavian Logic Symposium (SLS 2018) was held at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden during June 11-13, 2018, under the auspices of the Scandinavian Logic Society. The previous two meetings of the SLS were held in Tampere, Finland (2014) and Roskilde, Denmark (2012).</p>

<p>The primary aim of the Symposium is to promote research in the field of logic (broadly conceived) carried out in research communities in Scandinavia. Moreover, it warmly invites participation of logicians from all over the world. The meeting will include invited lectures and a forum for participants to present contributed talks.</p>

<p>The scope of this event covers mathematical, computational, and philosophical logic. The major topics include (but are not limited to) the areas of Proof Theory, Constructivism, Model Theory, Set Theory, Computability Theory, Algebra and Logic, Categorical Logic, Logic and Computer Science, Logic and Linguistics, Logic in AI and Multi-Agent Systems, Logics of Games, Modal and other non-classical Logics, Axiomatic Theories of Truth, and Philosophical Logic.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce that the 2018 Lindström Lectures will be a part of SLS 2018 and delivered by Michael Rathjen. For more information see <a href="/lindstrom-lectures">Lindström lectures webpage</a>.</p>

<p>SLS 2018 is collocated with the <a href="https://gu-clasp.github.io/events/conferences/dialogue-and-percetion-workshop/">Workshop on Dialogue and Perception 2018</a>, June 14-15, 2018.</p>

<p>Invited speakers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Joel David Hamkins</strong> (CUNY): <em>Set-theoretic potentialism and the
universal finite set</em><br />
Providing a set-theoretic analogue of the universal algorithm, I
shall define a certain finite set in set theory {x | φ(x)} and
prove that it exhibits a universal extension property: it can be any
desired particular finite set in the right set-theoretic universe
and it can become successively any desired larger finite set in
top-extensions of that universe. Specifically, ZFC proves the set is
finite; the definition φ has complexity Σ₂ and therefore any
instance of it φ(x) is locally verifiable inside any sufficiently
large V~θ~; the set is empty in any transitive model; and if φ
defines the set y in some countable model M of ZFC and y ⊂ z for
some finite set z in M, then there is a top-extension of M to a
model N of ZFC in which φ(x) defines the new set z. I shall draw out
consequences of the universal finite set for set-theoretic
potentialism and discuss several issues it raises in the philosophy
of set theory.<br />
The talk will include joint work with W. Hugh Woodin, Øystein
Linnebo and others. Questions and commentary concerning the talk can
be made at: <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/set-theoretic-potentialism-sls-2018">http://jdh.hamkins.org/set-theoretic-potentialism-sls-2018</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Luke Ong</strong> (Oxford): <em>Higher-order constrained Horn clauses and
automatic program verification</em><br />
We introduce constrained Horn clauses in higher-order logic, and
study satisfiability and related decision problems motivated by the
automatic verification of higher-order programs. Although
satisfiable systems of higher-order clauses in the standard
semantics do not generally have least models, by viewing these
systems as a kind of monotone logic programs, we show that there are
non-standard semantics that do satisfy the least model property.
Moreover the respective satisfiability problems in the standard and
non-standard semantics are inter-reducible. With a view to
exploiting the remarkable efficiency of SMT solvers, we survey
recent developments in the algorithmic solution of higher-order Horn
systems by reduction to first order, and discuss related problems.</p>

    <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Public Lindström Lecture on Monday:
<em>Progressions of theories and slow consistency</em><br />
The fact that “natural” theories, i.e. theories which have something
like an “idea” to them, are almost always linearly ordered with
regard to logical strength has been called one of the great
mysteries of the foundation of mathematics. Using paradoxical
methods, e.g. self-reference Rosser-style, one can distill theories
with incomparable logical strengths and show that the degree
structure of logical strengths is dense in that between two theories
S &lt; T one can always find a third Q such that S &lt; Q &lt; T . But are
there “natural” examples of such phenomena? We also know how to
produce a stronger theory by adding the consistency of the theory.
Can we get a stronger theory by adding something weaker than
consistency that is still “natural”? These and other questions will
be broached in the talk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Michael Rathjen</strong> (Leeds) Research Lindström Lecture on Wednesday:
<em>Bounds for the strength of the graph minor and the immersion
theorem</em><br />
The graph minor theorem, GM, is arguably the most important theorem
of graph theory. The strength of GM exceeds that of the standard
classification systems of RM known as the “big five”. The plan is to
survey the current knowledge about the strength of GM and other
Kruskal-like principles, presenting lower and upper bounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Katrin Tent</strong> (Münster): <em>Ampleness in strongly minimal
structures</em><br />
The notion of ampleness captures essential properties of projective
spaces over fields. It is natural to ask whether any sufficiently
ample strongly minimal set arises from an algebraically closed
field. In this talk I will explain the question and survey recent
results on ample strongly minimal structures.</p>
